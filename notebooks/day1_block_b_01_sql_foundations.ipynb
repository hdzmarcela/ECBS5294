    "\n",
    "### The Hook\n",
    "\n",
    "> **\"SQL lets you ask questions of data in the language of business logic, not programming loops.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "Think about it: Instead of writing loops and if-statements to find \"all coffee sales over $5,\" you just write:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT * FROM sales WHERE category = 'Coffee' AND price > 5\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You **declare what you want**, not how to get it. The database figures out the most efficient way to get your answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why SQL Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "**1. Declarative, Not Procedural**\n",
    "- Say *what* you want, not *how* to get it\n",
    "- Database optimizes the query for you\n",
    "- Focus on business logic, not algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "**2. Set-Based Operations**\n",
    "- Operate on entire sets of rows at once\n",
    "- Not row-by-row loops (which are slow)\n",
    "- Optimized for bulk operations\n",
    "\n",
    "**3. Standard and Portable**\n",
    "- SQL skills transfer across systems\n",
    "- PostgreSQL, MySQL, BigQuery, Snowflake, DuckDB all use SQL\n",
    "- Learn once, use everywhere\n",
    "\n",
    "**4. Foundation for Advanced Concepts**\n",
    "- Required for joins (Day 2)\n",
    "- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)\n",
    "- Window functions\n",
    "- Subqueries\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: Python vs SQL\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python (procedural):**\n",
    "```python\n",
    "total = 0\n",
    "for row in data:\n",
    "    if row['category'] == 'Coffee' and row['price'] > 5:\n",
    "        total += row['price'] * row['quantity']\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL (declarative):**\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT SUM(price * quantity) AS total_revenue\n",
    "FROM data\n",
    "WHERE category = 'Coffee' AND price > 5\n",

    "## 2. Why DuckDB?\n",
    "\n",
    "### What is DuckDB?\n",
    "\n",
    "DuckDB is an **embedded analytical database**. Think of it as \"SQLite for analytics.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key Features:**\n",
    "- **No server required** - runs in your Python process\n",
    "- **Query files directly** - CSVs, Parquet, no loading step!\n",
    "- **Fast** - columnar storage, optimized for analytics\n",
    "- **Full SQL support** - including window functions, CTEs, complex joins\n",
    "- **Works with pandas** - easy conversion to/from DataFrames\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use DuckDB\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Use DuckDB when:**\n",
    "- Analyzing data locally (CSVs, Parquet files)\n",
    "- Exploring datasets (millions of rows)\n",
    "- Building data pipelines\n",
    "- Learning SQL\n",
    "- You need speed without server setup\n",
    "\n",
    "❌ **Don't use DuckDB when:**\n",
    "- You need a web application database (use PostgreSQL)\n",
    "- You need multi-user concurrent writes (use PostgreSQL)\n",
    "- You're building a production transactional system\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why We're Teaching DuckDB\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Zero setup** - just `pip install duckdb`\n",
    "2. **Same SQL** - skills transfer to PostgreSQL, BigQuery, etc.\n",
    "3. **Real performance** - handles millions of rows on a laptop\n",
    "4. **Modern tool** - used by data teams at companies like Mozilla, Datadog\n",

    "2. **Why DuckDB?** - No server, query files directly, fast, modern\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core Concepts\n",
    "3. **SELECT** - Choose which columns to return\n",
    "4. **WHERE** - Filter which rows to return\n",
    "   - Comparison operators: `=`, `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `!=`\n",
    "   - Logical operators: `AND`, `OR`, `NOT`\n",
    "   - Special operators: `IN`, `BETWEEN`, `LIKE`\n",
    "   - **NULL handling:** `IS NULL`, `IS NOT NULL` (never `= NULL`!)\n",
    "5. **Calculated columns** - Create new columns with expressions\n",
    "6. **ORDER BY** - Sort results (ASC or DESC)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Query Building\n",
    "7. Build incrementally: Start simple, add complexity\n",
    "8. Use `LIMIT` while developing\n",
    "9. Check for NULLs in WHERE clauses\n",
