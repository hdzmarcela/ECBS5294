    "\n",
    "**Key concepts:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **URL/Endpoint:** The web address that returns data\n",
    "   - Example: `https://dummyjson.com/products`\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **HTTP Methods:** What you want to do\n",
    "   - `GET` - Retrieve data (most common for data pipelines)\n",
    "   - `POST` - Send data\n",
    "   - `PUT` - Update data\n",
    "   - `DELETE` - Remove data\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Status Codes:** Did it work?\n",
    "   - `200` - Success!\n",
    "   - `404` - Not Found\n",
    "   - `429` - Rate Limit Exceeded (too many requests)\n",
    "   - `500` - Server Error\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Response Format:** Usually JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)\n",
    "   - Structured data that's easy to parse\n",
    "   - Readable by humans and machines\n",

    "3. **`skip: 0`** - We're at the beginning (pagination offset)\n",

    "- HTTP GET requests fetch data from URLs\n",
    "- Status codes tell us if the request succeeded\n",

    "✅ **JSON Structure**\n",
    "- JSON has objects (dicts), arrays (lists), and primitives\n",
    "- Nesting creates complex structures (and challenges!)\n",
    "- Accessing nested data requires navigating levels\n",
    "\n",
    "✅ **Safe Navigation**\n",

    "\n",
    "- [ ] Use `requests` library for HTTP calls\n",
    "- [ ] Set `timeout` parameter (don't wait forever!)\n",
    "- [ ] Check `response.status_code` or use `.raise_for_status()`\n",
    "- [ ] Use `.get(key, default)` for optional fields\n",
    "- [ ] Test with actual API before writing pipeline logic\n",
