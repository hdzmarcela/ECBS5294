# HW3 Grading Guide

**Assignment:** End-to-End Data Integration Project
**Total Points:** 100
**Due:** October 29, 23:59

---

## Grading Philosophy

**HW3 is the capstone** - it integrates everything from Days 1-3:
- SQL querying and aggregation
- Multi-format data loading (CSV + JSON)
- JSON normalization
- Bronze → Silver → Gold pipelines
- Data validations
- Business thinking and communication

**Grade for:**
- ✅ Correctness: Does it work?
- ✅ Data thinking: Do they understand the data?
- ✅ Reproducibility: Can you run it?
- ✅ Communication: Can you understand their decisions?

**Don't grade for:**
- ❌ Code elegance (this isn't a CS course)
- ❌ Optimization (slow queries are fine if correct)
- ❌ Advanced techniques not taught

---

## Rubric Breakdown

### Part 1: Data Ingestion (15 points)

**What to look for:**

✅ **Full credit (15 pts):**
- Loaded both Chicago CSV and NYC JSON
- Used relative paths (`data/day3/hw3_data_pack/...`)
- Displayed sample rows with `.head()` or similar
- Printed row/column counts
- No errors when running cells

✅ **Partial credit:**
- 12 pts: Loaded both but absolute paths used
- 10 pts: Loaded only one dataset correctly
- 5 pts: Attempted but has errors

❌ **No credit (0 pts):**
- Didn't attempt or completely wrong approach

**Common issues:**
- Absolute paths: `/Users/student/...` instead of `data/...`
- Not displaying data (just loads silently)
- JSON not properly read (kept as string)

---

### Part 2: Bronze Layer (20 points)

**What to look for:**

✅ **Full credit (20 pts):**
- Created `bronze_chicago` and `bronze_nyc` tables
- Tables are exact copies of loaded data (no transformations)
- Used `CREATE TABLE AS SELECT * FROM ...` or similar
- Verified with row count checks
- Code runs without errors

✅ **Partial credit:**
- 15 pts: Both tables created but minor issues (extra columns, filtering)
- 10 pts: Only one bronze table created correctly
- 5 pts: Attempted but tables don't contain right data

❌ **No credit (0 pts):**
- No bronze tables created
- Bronze layer includes cleaning (that's silver!)

**Common issues:**
- Students clean data in bronze (mixing bronze/silver)
- Column selection instead of SELECT *
- Not actually creating tables (just DataFrames)

**Quick check:**
```python
# Run this in their notebook
bronze_count_chicago = con.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bronze_chicago").fetchone()[0]
bronze_count_nyc = con.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM bronze_nyc").fetchone()[0]
# Should match CSV/JSON row counts
```

---

### Part 3: Silver Layer - Normalization (25 points)

**What to look for:**

✅ **Full credit (25 pts):**

**Chicago table (10 pts):**
- Correct data types (dates as DATE, numbers as FLOAT)
- Key columns present (license_id, legal_name, license_description, etc.)
- NULL handling documented

**NYC tables (15 pts):**
- `silver_nyc_permits` main table (10 pts)
  - Flattened structure (no nested JSON)
  - Correct types
  - Primary key (permit_id or similar)
- `silver_nyc_applicants` separate table (5 pts)
  - Extracted applicant info
  - Foreign key to permits
  - One-to-many relationship

✅ **Partial credit:**
- 20 pts: Chicago perfect, NYC partially normalized
- 15 pts: Chicago perfect, NYC not normalized (single table)
- 10 pts: Both attempted but type issues
- 5 pts: Basic cleaning but no normalization

❌ **No credit (0 pts):**
- No silver tables created
- Just copied bronze (no transformations)

**Common issues:**
- NYC JSON left as nested dicts/arrays
- Didn't separate applicants into own table
- Lat/lon kept as strings instead of floats
- Dates kept as strings

**Quick check:**
```python
# Check NYC normalization
permit_count = con.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM silver_nyc_permits").fetchone()[0]
applicant_count = con.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM silver_nyc_applicants").fetchone()[0]
# applicant_count should be >= permit_count (one-to-many)
```

---

### Part 4: Silver Layer - Validations (15 points)

**What to look for:**

✅ **Full credit (15 pts):**
- At least 3 meaningful validations (3 pts each)
- Clear error messages (don't just write `assert condition`)
- Validations actually run (not commented out)
- Examples:
  - Primary key uniqueness
  - Required fields non-null
  - Data type checks
  - Date range validation
  - Business rule validation

✅ **Partial credit:**
- 12 pts: 2 good validations
- 9 pts: 1 good validation
- 6 pts: Validations written but don't work
- 3 pts: Attempted but all trivial (`assert True`)

❌ **No credit (0 pts):**
- No validations
- All validations commented out

**Examples of GOOD validations:**
```python
# ✅ Primary key uniqueness
total = con.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM silver_chicago").fetchone()[0]
unique = con.execute("SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT license_id) FROM silver_chicago").fetchone()[0]
assert total == unique, f"Duplicate license_ids! Total: {total}, Unique: {unique}"

# ✅ Required field non-null
null_count = con.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM silver_nyc_permits WHERE permit_id IS NULL").fetchone()[0]
assert null_count == 0, f"Found {null_count} rows with NULL permit_id!"

# ✅ Business rule
neg_count = con.execute("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM silver_chicago WHERE license_fee < 0").fetchone()[0]
assert neg_count == 0, f"Found {neg_count} licenses with negative fees!"
```

**Examples of WEAK validations:**
```python
# ❌ Too vague
assert len(df) > 0, "No data"

# ❌ Trivial
assert True, "Data loaded"

# ❌ No error message
assert df['id'].is_unique
```

### Part 5: Gold Layer - Analytics (15 points)

**What to look for:**

✅ **Full credit (15 pts):**
- Created 5-7 KPI tables/queries (3 pts each, max 15)
- Each answers a clear business question
- Results are properly aggregated (GROUP BY, JOINs)
- Output displayed and makes sense
- Examples:
  - Licenses by business type
  - Permits by borough
  - Top license descriptions
  - Trend over time
  - Cross-dataset comparison

✅ **Partial credit:**
- 12 pts: 4 good KPIs
- 9 pts: 3 good KPIs
- 6 pts: 2 KPIs
- 3 pts: 1 KPI or attempted but incorrect

❌ **No credit (0 pts):**
- No gold layer
- Just SELECT * (no aggregation)

**Examples of GOOD KPIs:**
```sql
-- ✅ Clear business question: "Which business types are most common?"
SELECT
    license_description,
    COUNT(*) as num_licenses
FROM silver_chicago
GROUP BY license_description
ORDER BY num_licenses DESC
LIMIT 10

-- ✅ Trend analysis
SELECT
    YEAR(issue_date) as year,
    COUNT(*) as permits_issued
FROM silver_nyc_permits
GROUP BY YEAR(issue_date)
ORDER BY year

-- ✅ Cross-dataset insight
SELECT
    'Chicago' as city,
    COUNT(*) as business_count
FROM silver_chicago
UNION ALL
SELECT
    'NYC' as city,
    COUNT(*) as permit_count
FROM silver_nyc_permits
```

**Examples of WEAK KPIs:**
```sql
-- ❌ No aggregation
SELECT * FROM silver_chicago LIMIT 10

-- ❌ Too simple
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM silver_chicago

-- ❌ No business meaning
SELECT license_id FROM silver_chicago WHERE license_id > 1000
```

### Part 6: Documentation (10 points)

**What to look for:**

✅ **Full credit (10 pts):**
- **README or markdown cells** explaining the project (3 pts)
  - What datasets were used
  - What the pipeline does
  - How to run the notebook
- **Assumptions documented** (4 pts)
  - NULL handling decisions
  - Why certain rows were filtered
  - Data quality issues encountered
- **KPI interpretations** (3 pts)
  - What each gold query tells you
  - Business insights from results
  - Limitations of the analysis

✅ **Partial credit:**
- 7 pts: Has README/overview but missing assumptions
- 5 pts: Minimal documentation (only code comments)
- 3 pts: Very sparse, hard to understand what they did

❌ **No credit (0 pts):**
- No documentation at all
- Just code with no explanations

**What good documentation looks like:**

```markdown
## Assumptions

### Chicago Data
- Filtered out licenses with NULL `license_start_date` (847 rows, 1.7% of data)
- These appear to be incomplete applications
- Kept licenses with NULL `expiration_date` (assumed perpetual licenses)

### NYC Data
- Separated applicants into own table because permits can have multiple applicants
- Converted lat/lon strings to floats, 523 rows had invalid coordinates (set to NULL)
- Permits without valid addresses excluded from geographic analysis

## KPI Insights

### Top Business Types
- "Retail Food Establishment" is most common (8,234 licenses)
- Suggests Chicago has vibrant food scene
- Note: This doesn't account for business size or revenue

### Limitations
- Can't compare Chicago vs NYC directly (different permit types)
- Chicago data is licenses, NYC is building permits
- No revenue data, so can't assess economic impact
```

## Quick Grading Workflow

**Estimated time per assignment: 15-20 minutes**

### Step 1: Run notebook (5 min)
```bash
jupyter nbconvert --to notebook --execute hw3_starter.ipynb --inplace
```
- If it runs without errors → good sign for reproducibility
- If it crashes → check if it's absolute paths or real logic errors

### Step 2: Spot check outputs (5 min)
- Bronze row counts match source data?
- Silver tables have correct structure (check schema)?
- Validations actually ran (not commented out)?
- Gold queries return sensible results?

### Step 3: Grade by rubric (5 min)
- Use scorecard (see below)
- Mark off points for each section
- Note specific issues

### Step 4: Written feedback (3 min)
- Highlight what they did well
- Note 1-2 areas for improvement
- Keep it concise

### Step 5: Final score (2 min)
- Sum up all parts
- Double-check math
- Enter in Moodle

## Common Student Mistakes

### 1. Absolute paths
**Issue:** `/Users/student/Downloads/data.csv`
**Impact:** Won't run on grader's machine
**Penalty:** -2 to -5 points (reproducibility)
**Fix guidance:** "Use relative paths: `data/day3/hw3_data_pack/...`"

### 2. Skipping validations
**Issue:** Part 4 empty or trivial
**Impact:** Major conceptual gap
**Penalty:** 0-6 points (instead of 15)
**Fix guidance:** "Validations ensure data quality. Add assertions for primary keys, non-null fields, and business rules."

### 3. Not normalizing NYC JSON
**Issue:** Left applicants as nested array
**Impact:** Can't properly query or join
**Penalty:** -5 to -10 points
**Fix guidance:** "Extract applicant array into separate table with foreign key back to permits."

### 4. Weak gold layer
**Issue:** Just SELECT * queries, no aggregation
**Impact:** Doesn't demonstrate analytical thinking
**Penalty:** 0-6 points (instead of 15)
**Fix guidance:** "Use GROUP BY, JOINs, and aggregates (COUNT, SUM, AVG) to answer business questions."

### 5. No documentation
**Issue:** Just code, no explanations
**Impact:** Can't understand their decisions
**Penalty:** 0-3 points (instead of 10)
**Fix guidance:** "Add markdown cells explaining your assumptions, especially how you handled NULLs and why you filtered certain rows."

## Edge Cases

### What if their approach is different but correct?

**Example:** Student uses pandas instead of SQL for everything

**Answer:** That's fine! Grade based on:
- Does it work?
- Did they create the 3 layers?
- Are validations present?
- Are results correct?

Method doesn't matter as long as concepts are demonstrated.

### What if they found a data quality issue you didn't notice?

**Example:** Student discovers that Chicago has duplicate license IDs for renewals

**Answer:**
- This is GOOD data thinking!
- Give full credit even if their approach differs from yours
- Consider bonus points for excellent analysis
- Update your own solution notes

### What if notebook won't run?

**Try:**
1. Check for absolute paths - fix manually and re-run
2. Check for missing datasets - are files in right location?
3. Check for hardcoded values - adjust and re-run

**If still won't run:**
- Grade what you can see (code structure, logic)
- Deduct reproducibility points
- Leave feedback: "Couldn't run notebook - please use relative paths and test with Restart & Run All"

### What if they went WAY above and beyond?

**Example:** Created 15 KPIs, beautiful visualizations, perfect documentation

**Answer:**
- Cap at 100 points (no extra credit)
- Leave enthusiastic feedback
- Consider sharing (anonymously) as example for future students
- Mention in class (if appropriate): "Someone did an amazing job on HW3!"

---

## Time-Saving Tips

### Batch grade similar issues
- If 5 students made same mistake, write feedback once and copy/paste

### Use rubric strictly
- Don't overthink - if validation is there and works, give points
- Don't deduct for style issues (unless specifically wrong)

### Prioritize correctness over elegance
- Ugly code that works > beautiful code that doesn't
- This is a data course, not a software engineering course

### Focus on big picture
- Did they demonstrate understanding of pipelines?
- Can they validate data?
- Can they think analytically?

## Post-Grading Actions

**After grading all submissions:**

1. **Calculate statistics**
   - Average score
   - Distribution
   - Common mistakes

2. **Create summary for class**
   - Don't name names
   - Highlight common issues
   - Share best practices observed

3. **Update teaching notes**
   - What did students struggle with?
   - What needs more emphasis next year?
   - Were instructions clear?

4. **Prepare for final exam**
   - Students weak on validations → review in exam prep
   - Students strong on SQL → can focus elsewhere

---

## Summary

**HW3 is comprehensive** - it tests everything from the course:
- Technical skills (SQL, Python, data processing)
- Conceptual understanding (pipelines, normalization)
- Professional skills (documentation, reproducibility)

**Grade fairly but firmly:**
- Give credit for correct work
- Deduct for missing key concepts
- Provide constructive feedback

**Remember:**
- This is a learning exercise, not a job evaluation
- Students are still developing these skills
- Your feedback shapes their understanding

**Estimated grading time:** 4-6 hours for 20 students

**Good luck with grading!** 🎓
