# Homework 2: TechMart Acquisition Data Integration

**Course:** ECBS5294 - Introduction to Data Science: Working with Data
**Due:** Day 3, Start of Class
**Total Points:** 100
**Est. Time:** 3-4 hours

---

## 🏢 The Business Scenario

You've just been hired as a Junior Data Analyst at **TechMart**, a rapidly growing e-commerce company that sells electronics, beauty products, and home goods online.

### The Situation

TechMart recently acquired **QuickBuy**, a smaller competitor, for $12 million. QuickBuy's entire product catalog and customer review system runs on a NoSQL database that exports everything as nested JSON.

Your manager walks into your cubicle on Monday morning:

> "We need QuickBuy's product data integrated into our analytics warehouse by Wednesday morning. Their API dumps everything as one massive JSON file - products, reviews, tags, everything nested together. Our BI team uses SQL and can't work with JSON.
>
> Can you normalize this into proper tables so we can analyze their product performance? The board meeting is Wednesday at 9 AM, and the executives need to know:
> 1. Which QuickBuy product categories we should keep vs discontinue
> 2. How their customer satisfaction compares to ours
> 3. Which products drive the most engagement
> 4. If there are any concerning patterns in negative reviews
>
> This is your first big project - nail this and you'll be presenting to the CFO next quarter!"

### Your Mission

Transform QuickBuy's messy JSON export into clean, normalized database tables that answer critical business questions before the board meeting.

### Why This Matters

- **$2.5M inventory decision**: Which product lines to keep
- **Customer retention**: Understanding satisfaction levels
- **Marketing budget**: Where to invest based on engagement
- **Integration timeline**: 50 developers waiting for your schema

## 📊 Dataset: QuickBuy Product Catalog

### Attribution & License
**Source:** DummyJSON - Free Fake REST API for Testing and Prototyping
**URL:** https://dummyjson.com/docs/products
**License:** Public API - Free to use for testing, prototyping, and educational purposes
**Attribution:** Not required but appreciated
**Downloaded:** Complete dataset (all 194 products)
**Educational Use:** ✅ Explicitly permitted

> **Note for students:** This is a public API designed for learning. In real work, always verify data licenses and usage rights!

### Dataset Details
- **Complete catalog:** All 194 products from QuickBuy's acquisition
- **Customer reviews:** 582 reviews across all products
- **Product-tag relationships:** 364 tags
- **Unique categories:** 24 product categories
- **File size:** 316 KB
- **Location:** `data/products.json`

### Why This Dataset?
DummyJSON provides realistic e-commerce data that mirrors real-world API responses:
- Complex nested structures (like production NoSQL exports)
- Realistic business data (products, reviews, ratings)
- No authentication required (focus on transformation, not API complexity)
- Designed for educational use

### JSON Structure

Each product contains:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "title": "Product Name",
  "price": 9.99,
  "category": "beauty",
  "dimensions": {
    "width": 23.17,
    "height": 14.43,
    "depth": 28.01
  },
  "meta": {
    "createdAt": "2024-05-23T08:56:21.618Z",
    "updatedAt": "2024-05-23T08:56:21.618Z",
    "barcode": "9164035109868"
  },
  "reviews": [
    {
      "rating": 2,
      "comment": "Very unhappy with my purchase!",
      "date": "2024-05-23T08:56:21.618Z",
      "reviewerName": "John Doe",
      "reviewerEmail": "john.doe@x.dummyjson.com"
    }
  ],
  "tags": ["beauty", "mascara"]
}
```

### Data Characteristics

**Nested Objects to Flatten:**
- `dimensions` → width, height, depth columns
- `meta` → created_at, updated_at, barcode columns

**Arrays to Normalize:**
- `reviews` → Separate reviews table (one-to-many, 582 total reviews)
- `tags` → Separate product_tags table (many-to-many, 364 relationships)

**Data Quality Notes:**
- All products have at least one review
- No missing core fields (id, title, price, category)
- Dates in ISO 8601 format
- Prices in USD (float)
- Average 3 reviews per product
- Categories span electronics, beauty, groceries, and more

## 💡 Tips for Success

### Normalization Strategy

1. **Start with exploration:** Understand the JSON structure first
2. **Flatten incrementally:**
   - First: Create products table (flatten dimensions, meta)
   - Then: Extract reviews (maintain product_id)
   - Finally: Extract tags (create bridge table)
3. **Verify relationships:** Check foreign keys match
4. **Count everything:** Ensure no data loss

### Common Patterns

**Flattening nested objects:**
```python
# Extract nested fields
df['width'] = df['dimensions'].apply(lambda x: x['width'])
df['height'] = df['dimensions'].apply(lambda x: x['height'])
```

**Extracting arrays to separate table:**
```python
# Extract reviews with foreign key
reviews_list = []
for product in products:
    product_id = product['id']
    for review in product['reviews']:
        review_row = {'product_id': product_id, **review}
        reviews_list.append(review_row)
```

**Creating bridge table for many-to-many:**
```python
# Product-tag relationships
tags_list = []
for product in products:
    for tag in product['tags']:
        tags_list.append({
            'product_id': product['id'],
            'tag': tag
        })
```

### Validation Best Practices

Always verify:
```python
# Primary keys are unique
assert df['id'].is_unique, "Duplicate IDs found!"

# Foreign keys are valid
assert reviews_df['product_id'].isin(products_df['id']).all()

# No data lost
assert len(reviews_df) == total_reviews_in_json

# Correct types
assert pd.api.types.is_datetime64_any_dtype(df['created_at'])
```

### Business Context

Remember you're answering board questions:
- **Category decisions:** Which have best reviews?
- **Engagement metrics:** Which products get most feedback?
- **Quality concerns:** Any patterns in low ratings?
- **Integration priorities:** What needs attention first?

## 🚫 Academic Integrity

### What You CAN Do

✅ Review course notebooks and materials
✅ Consult pandas/DuckDB documentation
✅ Discuss concepts with classmates (conceptual only)
✅ Ask instructor/TA for clarification
✅ Use the validation script to check your work

### What You CANNOT Do

❌ Use AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude, Copilot, etc.)
❌ Copy code from classmates
❌ Share your solution with others
❌ Look up complete solutions online
❌ Use solutions from previous years

**Why?** We need to assess YOUR understanding. The board meeting depends on accurate analysis!

### Violations

Academic integrity violations will result in:
- Zero on the assignment
- Report to CEO (course instructor)
- Potential termination (course failure)

## ❓ Getting Help

### If You're Stuck

1. **Review Day 2 Block B notebooks** - normalization examples
2. **Check the JSON structure carefully** - print intermediate steps
3. **Verify your transformations** - use .head() and .shape
4. **Read error messages** - they often tell you the issue
5. **Ask for help!** - Office hours, email, course forum

### Common Issues

**"KeyError when accessing nested field"**
- Check if field exists: `product.get('dimensions', {})`
- Handle missing values gracefully

**"Assertion fails on foreign keys"**
- Print both sets of IDs to compare
- Check for type mismatches (int vs string)

**"Wrong number of rows after normalization"**
- Count in original JSON first
- Check your loops aren't skipping items

**"SQL JOIN returns empty"**
- Verify table names
- Check column names match
- Ensure foreign keys align

---

## 🗓️ Timeline

**Recommended schedule:**

- **Day 2, After Block B:** Start Part 1 & 2 (Ingestion & Normalization) - 1.5 hours
- **Day 2, Evening:** Complete Part 3 & 4 (Validation & DuckDB) - 1 hour
- **Between classes:** Part 5 & 6 (SQL Analysis & Documentation) - 1 hour
- **Before Day 3:** Review, test end-to-end, submit - 30 minutes

**Don't wait!** The board meeting (and your grade) depends on this!

## 🎓 Learning Goals

This assignment simulates real data integration work:

1. **Understanding messy data** - Real APIs return nested JSON
2. **Normalization skills** - Converting NoSQL to relational
3. **Data quality mindset** - Never trust, always verify
4. **Business thinking** - Technical work serves business decisions
5. **Documentation habits** - Others depend on your work

By completing this, you'll have done actual data analyst work that companies need every day during mergers and acquisitions.
